HOW TO USE THE TOOL 

The given ipynb file contains parser and superscalar simulator programs.  

Parser to reschedule(optimize). The code and simulator to count number of cycles. 

Open google colab and clone the repository 

!git clone https://github.com/NIKHITHAVADDEMPUDI/CS23M117_CSA_PROJECT.git 

In the clone repository open CSA_PARSER_superscalar_simulator.ipynb file. 

Copy paste the path of dhrystone.s mips file path in the program near ending of parser to optimize mips file and generate a file with name resheduled_mips.s in the home or current directory. 

Copy paste the paths of dhrystone.s and resheduled_mips.s paths in super scalar simulator to compare the number of clock cycles taken to execute and compare the performance
